  /** the following goes in your Preferences / Key Bindings - User:

  (You can edit that file with a quick âŒ˜+shift+p "key user")

  {
    "keys": ["shift+enter"],
    "command": "send_selection_to_term"
  }

  Or if you want to only send text to the terminal in Python source files, for example, you can add a "context", which limits where the key-binding applies.

  {
    "keys": ["shift+enter"],
    "command": "send_selection_to_term",
    "context": [
      { "key": "selector", "operator": "equal", "operand": "source.python" }
    ]
  }

  but since we don't want to hijack (duplicate) any of your keybindings,
  we don't actually set that here. Instead, for demo purposes, we use an
  obscure key combo: control + alt + command + enter
